			<p>In a society reliant on the constant development of new science and technology, diversity in STEM diversity is a pressing issue. At present, science and technology fields are laregely dominated by white men. These trends are visible throughout higher education, academia, and industry.</p>
			
			<h2 class="bold-text">Why does this matter?</h2>
			<p>Studies have shown that diversity improves outcomes for group work. </p>
			<p>In order to develop effective technologies, engineering populations should be representative of their user populations. </p>
			<p>All students and workers should be treated with equal dignity and respect.</p> 

			<h4>** There is little to no hard data regarding the experience of non-binary and gender non-conforming people in STEM. We recognize that these visualizations are not a perfect representation of the gender breakdown, and that the lived experiences of people outside the gender binary is real. **</h4>

		<h2>Median Annual Salaries of U.S. Scientists & Engineers</h2>
		<h3>Salary data across all degree levels shows that women and employees of color in STEM fields are paid less <br /> than their male and white counterparts. Some smaller fields such as aerospace engineering <br /> show equal parity, but other fields still need to do better. It's not rocket science!</h3>

			<h2 class="bold-text">Let's take a closer look at where the disparities in gender come from.</h2>
			<p>Some people attribute these phenomena to biological differences, claiming that women simply have different strengths and interests from men. However, we believe that social factors play the most significant role in discouraging women from pursuing careers in STEM.</p>
